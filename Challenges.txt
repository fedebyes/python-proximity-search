Proximity Measure
Coding Challenge
================
 
Overview
--------
You are asked to complete the coding challenge which is described in detail in
the following paragraphs. Kindly note the following requirements:
 
* Use the Python 2.7+ programming language to complete the challenge.
* Do not use any external libraries, only the pure Python 2.7+ core modules.
* Structure your code into a Python module and add a simple unit test.
* Comment your code wisely.
 
It should not take you more than 3 hours to complete the challenge.
 
 
Challenge
---------
 
The challenge consists in writing a piece of code which returns a **proximity
measure** between an arbitrary query string (consisting of one or multiple
words) and a reference text (consisting of many words).
A simple example implementation is provided below::
 
    def proximity(text, query_string):
        """Return a Boolean proximity measure, `True` if `query_string` is present
        in `text`, `False` if not.
        """
        ret = query_string in text
        return ret
 
 
Obviously, a more elaborate proximity measure is to be implemented that e.g.
takes into account the length of the reference text, the location of the
matching terms, the occurrence of known normalization tokens, etc. It is up to
you to decide what kind of features to include in your algorithm. Moreover, a
return value other than a simple Boolean should be added. Usually, these kind
of algorithms return a floating point number between zero and one.
 
In general, it is better to have a simple working solution than no solution at
all. However, an implementation which is too simplistic is not ideal either.
In that sense you must compromise on the complexity and completeness of your
approach, given the restricted time frame of 3 hours.
 
 
Examples
````````
To facilitate the implementation the following examples can be used:
 
* Sample query string:
 
  * "Continental"
  * "Continental Breakfast in Zürich"
  * "Continental Automotive Systems, Inc. in Morgaton, NC"
  * "This is not a system"
 
* Sample Texts:
 
  * Continental does not have an office in Zürich.
 
  * The Burke County location of Continental is a division of a larger
    corporation with sales of around $46 billion in 2013. Continental is among
    the leading automotive suppliers worldwide. As a supplier of brake
    systems, systems and components for powertrains and chassis,
    instrumentation, infotainment solutions, vehicle electronics, tires, and
    technical elastomers, Continental contributes to enhanced driving safety
    and global climate protection.  Continental is also an expert partner in
    networked automobile communication.  Continental currently employs around
    178,000 people in 49 countries. The two Morganton facilities are part of
    the Vehicle Dynamics Business Unit, which is one of four Business Units
    within Continental.
 
  * “We are proud of our company, our products and our facilities,” said Naomi
    Cole, senior human resource manager for Continental Automotive Systems in
    Morganton. “Each of us has an important job to do, and ultimately the
    success of our company depends upon how well we individually and
    collectively perform our jobs and ultimately satisfy our customers. We
    seek employees who have the ability to contribute toward our success in a
    meaningful way. It is the success of our company as a profitable business
    that will increase our job security, opportunities for personal growth,
    and support Burke and the surrounding counties.”
 
  * The report reveals that Bridgestone, Michelin, Goodyear, Pirelli and
    Continental are few of the dominant tyre manufacturers in the UAE,
    accounting for a substantial share in the country's tyre market. These
    leading players are constantly growing due to their well-established
    supply chain network, comprising exclusive distributorships and local
    dealers.
